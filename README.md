# my-ETL_project-_pipeline_Streamlit-Visualizations-
This project is an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline integrated with Streamlit for dynamic and interactive data visualizations. The project extracts cryptocurrency price data, transforms and cleans it, loads it into a MySQL database, and presents insightful, real-time visualizations through a web-based Streamlit dashboard.
The visualizations allow users to interactively explore data trends, price movements, and trading volumes using simple, intuitive Python scripts. Built on top of cleaned and structured data, this project demonstrates the complete data workflow  from extraction to visualization.
